# Image-Sorting
Sort the photographs according to the people present in it. 
Steps to run:
1. Train your photographs (face_train.py)
2. When you are done with training (with around 70 photographs), run rename.py.
3. Rename.py changes the name of all the photographs present in the same folder to "name1&name2&name3...."
